Note that the SVM runs in jupyter notebook. You can access this environment even through web.


# Before working with Python, load the virtual environment
source /.../NaiveBayes/Python_Files/.venv/parma/bin/activate

# While in the folder /.../parma/NaiveBayes/Python_Files, start the jupyter notebook with
jupyter notebook


# 1. Download the parts from Hadoop hdfs for the epsilon into the /.../parma/NaiveBayes/Python_Files/data folder

# 2. If multiple files are present (part-r-*), concatenate them into a single file
cat part-r-00000-0.6 part-r-00001-0.6 > combined_0.6.dat

# 3. Modify the current_epsilon value and Do 'Kernel -> Restart and Run All'
